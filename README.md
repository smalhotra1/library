# library
This is my Home work assignment 1 and my first python program too
So, i am representing two data sets which are related to information about two types of books categories in library i.e for kids and for teenagers
my motive was to comapre both the data sets and display some useful information 
it was a little tricky for me initially as i am completely naive to python and this is my first project in it. 
I learned python in a week so i wanted to do all the operations i can do on the project.

HOW IT WORKS?
So at first you will be able to  see all the names of the books present in the library. It will display a list of books present in both sets
Secondly if you want to sort out the books, you can do it by enterning the publishing date and it will count that how many books are published in the same year and are present in the set
this is a simple comparision , we can extend it to find authors of the books etc.
